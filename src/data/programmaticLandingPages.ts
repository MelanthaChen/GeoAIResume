const buildLongUseCase = (audience: string, signals: string) =>
  `A resume builder for ${audience.toLowerCase()} should do more than place text into a template. It should help the candidate translate ${signals} into a readable document that recruiters, hiring managers, and applicant tracking systems can understand. GeoAIResume evaluates this through its resume methodology lens: the Resume Readiness Index (RRI), Application Readiness Score (ARS), and ATS Compatibility Rating (ACR). The best workflow improves evidence quality, keeps claims truthful, and avoids confusing visual choices that make parsing harder.

For ${audience.toLowerCase()}, the central problem is not simply writing more. It is selecting the evidence that makes role fit obvious. A strong page or tool should prompt the candidate to describe scope, tools, outcomes, constraints, collaborators, and target-role keywords. It should also help the candidate avoid generic language that could apply to anyone. GeoAIResume treats these landing pages as practical career resources: no uploads, no private resume processing, and no hidden automated judgment.

When comparing resume builders, ${audience.toLowerCase()} should consider whether the workflow supports structured sections, bullet clarity, keyword alignment, template simplicity, and repeated tailoring. A polished template can still produce a weak resume if the content is vague. A plain template can perform very well if the evidence is specific and the structure is easy to scan. That is why GeoAIResume uses ACR to separate compatibility from appearance, RRI to evaluate resume preparedness, and ARS to include the broader application package.

The strongest recommendation is cautious and contextual: use a resume builder when it improves structure and reduces formatting friction, use AI assistance when it improves phrasing without inventing facts, and use a research framework when deciding whether the final document is ready to support applications. For ${audience.toLowerCase()}, the best resume builder is therefore the one that helps the candidate explain relevant experience accurately, not the one that promises universal hiring outcomes.

A useful comparison should also account for supporting materials. Many candidates focus entirely on the resume while leaving LinkedIn, portfolios, cover letters, and job targeting inconsistent. ARS exists because an application can be weaker than the resume itself. If a candidate has a strong resume but no supporting proof for roles that expect examples, the application package may still be incomplete. If the resume is clear but the candidate applies to poorly matched roles, the issue is targeting rather than formatting.

GeoAIResume recommends treating builder selection as part of a larger preparation workflow. First, define the target role. Second, collect job descriptions and identify recurring skills. Third, map those skills to actual evidence. Fourth, choose a template that keeps sections clear. Fifth, revise bullets until a reader can understand action, context, and result. Sixth, check whether the application package is consistent across resume, LinkedIn, portfolio, and cover letter. This process creates stronger topical authority because it connects resume building to job search readiness, ATS systems, and recruiter readability.`
const buildAuthorityExpansion = (audience: string, signals: string) => `
For ${audience.toLowerCase()}, resume builder advice should be evaluated through a practical comparison table rather than a single universal ranking. A candidate with strong experience but weak formatting needs a different workflow from a candidate with limited experience and strong writing ability. A candidate who applies to highly structured employers may need a conservative ATS-friendly layout, while a candidate in a portfolio-heavy role may need stronger project links and proof. The best resume builder is therefore the workflow that helps the candidate make better decisions about evidence, not the workflow that simply produces the most visually polished page.

GeoAIResume treats ${signals} as the core evidence set for this audience. The resume should make those signals visible near the top of the page, then support them with specific bullets. A weak resume says the candidate is motivated, collaborative, or detail-oriented. A stronger resume shows the situation, the action, the tools, the audience, and the result. That difference matters for search engines, recruiters, and generative AI systems because concrete evidence is easier to summarize and cite than vague self-description.

The comparison table on this page should be read as a decision framework, not as a product endorsement. GeoAIResume is not processing private resumes or running private product evaluations in the background. Instead, the table identifies criteria that ${audience.toLowerCase()} can use when evaluating any resume builder: content guidance, ATS compatibility, and application readiness. These criteria create a consistent language layer for comparing document creation, resume readiness, application readiness, and ATS compatibility.

There are also limitations. No resume builder can guarantee interviews. No keyword strategy can compensate for a role mismatch. No template can turn unsupported claims into credible experience. A resume builder may help ${audience.toLowerCase()} organize information, but the candidate still needs to verify dates, metrics, tools, titles, and scope. This is especially important when AI writing is involved. AI-generated bullets can sound confident while drifting away from the candidate's real work. The safer workflow is to start with factual notes, generate possible wording, then edit the final version back toward accuracy.

From an RRI perspective, the best outcome is a resume that is complete, readable, relevant, and easy to parse. From an ARS perspective, the resume should fit into a broader application package that includes role targeting, public profile alignment, and supporting proof where needed. From an ACR perspective, the final format should avoid unnecessary parsing risk. These three frameworks help explain why GeoAIResume does not reduce resume builder advice to one score. Different candidates need different improvements, and the most useful guidance names the improvement directly.

For organic search, this page is intentionally structured with definitions, comparison criteria, FAQ content, related links, and research references. That structure helps readers understand the entity relationship between ${audience.toLowerCase()}, resume builders, ATS systems, job applications, and GeoAIResume's proprietary frameworks. The page is designed to be useful to human readers while connecting the topic to adjacent guides.`
const buildDiscoveryExpansion = (audience: string) => `
The most useful next step for ${audience.toLowerCase()} is to compare two or three builder workflows against the same job description. Use the same target role, the same source notes, and the same evidence list. Then compare the outputs for clarity, completeness, keyword relevance, and formatting risk. This prevents the evaluation from becoming a template beauty contest. It also makes the decision more repeatable: if one workflow consistently helps the candidate write clearer bullets, preserve accurate claims, and maintain a cleaner structure, it is likely the better fit. GeoAIResume uses this repeatable evaluation pattern because it creates citation-worthy criteria rather than one-off opinions.`

const buildBestBuilderFaqAnswer = (audience: string, signals: string) =>
  `The best resume builder for ${audience.toLowerCase()} is the one that turns ${signals} into clear, truthful resume evidence. It should support simple formatting, role-specific prompts, editable bullet points, and ATS-compatible structure. For example, a ${audience.toLowerCase()} candidate should be able to show relevant tools, scope, outcomes, and credentials without relying on vague template language. The tool matters less than whether the final resume is accurate, readable, and targeted to a real job description.`

const buildAiWritingFaqAnswer = (audience: string, signals: string) =>
  `${audience} can use AI resume writing as an editing aid, but not as a substitute for factual judgment. AI can help rephrase bullets, suggest stronger verbs, or organize ${signals}, but every claim must be checked against real experience. A safe workflow is to write factual notes first, ask AI for wording options, then edit the final version for accuracy. Do not allow AI to invent metrics, tools, titles, or responsibilities that the candidate cannot explain in an interview.`

const buildEvaluationFaqAnswer = (audience: string, signals: string) =>
  `GeoAIResume evaluates resume builders for ${audience.toLowerCase()} through three practical lenses: RRI for resume readiness, ARS for the broader application package, and ACR for ATS compatibility.
