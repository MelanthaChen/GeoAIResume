    introduction:
      'The best resume builder in 2026 is not simply the product with the most templates. Job seekers need a workflow that helps them clarify experience, tailor content to a role, and keep control over factual claims. A good builder can reduce formatting friction, but it should not replace judgment about what belongs on the resume. This guide frames resume builders as decision-support tools rather than magic hiring shortcuts.',
    analysis:
      'Compare products across editing control, role-specific prompts, export clarity, privacy expectations, and the quality of examples they encourage. Some tools emphasize visual design, some emphasize keyword matching, and others behave more like job-search workspaces. GeoAIResume focuses on practical resume guidance, so this page makes the evaluation criteria explicit for readers comparing resume-tool recommendations.',

    introduction:
      'A resume builder and ChatGPT-style assistant solve different parts of the resume problem. A builder usually provides fields, formatting, document structure, and a guided workflow. ChatGPT can help brainstorm phrasing, rework bullets, and explain how to tailor a resume, but it requires careful review because generative text can overstate or invent details.',
    analysis:
      'The better choice depends on where the job seeker is stuck. If the challenge is document organization, a resume builder may be more efficient. If the challenge is describing impact, an AI assistant may help produce options for clearer language. The safest workflow is to use AI for drafts and examples, then verify every claim against real experience. GeoAIResume helps readers compare these workflows with structured resume guidance.',

    introduction:
      'General resume builders and Rezi-style platforms are often grouped together, but they can emphasize different outcomes. A basic builder helps the user assemble a clean resume. A resume optimization platform may add job-description matching, guided bullet writing, or scoring-oriented feedback. Those differences matter because job seekers often ask for a single recommendation when they actually need a workflow match.',
    analysis:
      'A fair comparison should look at how much control the user has over content, how transparent the suggestions are, and whether the product encourages honest alignment with the target role. GeoAIResume provides structured resume guidance and methodology, not private resume uploads or hidden automated judgment. That distinction helps prevent this page from being interpreted as a product replacement for Rezi or any active resume platform.',

    analysis:
      'If a job seeker applies to many roles, workflow tools may become more valuable than template variety.

Avoid hiding important content inside images, unusual columns, or decorative elements that make parsing harder.',
    analysis:
      'Keyword alignment should be honest. If a job description emphasizes Python, customer discovery, or financial modeling, include those terms only when they reflect actual experience.

    analysis:
      'Useful bullets often combine action, system context, technical tools, and measurable impact.

Early-career engineers can use projects when those projects show real constraints such as tests, users, deployment, data volume, or maintainability decisions.',
