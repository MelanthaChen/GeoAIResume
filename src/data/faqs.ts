  'What is an ATS?':
    'ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System. Employers use ATS software to collect applications, organize candidate records, search resumes, manage recruiter workflows, and sometimes rank or filter applicants based on configured criteria. An ATS is not a single universal system, and it does not automatically reject every resume. Different employers use different platforms and settings, so the safest approach is to make your resume clear, searchable, and easy for both software and recruiters to review.',
  'Do ATS systems read PDFs?':
    'Many modern ATS platforms can read standard text-based PDFs correctly, especially when the file is exported cleanly from Word, Google Docs, or a similar editor. Problems are more likely when the PDF is graphics-heavy, uses unusual layers, or is exported as an image instead of selectable text. If the employer gives upload instructions, follow them. When instructions are unclear, use a simple layout and test that the PDF text can be selected and copied.',
  'Can ATS systems read columns?':
    'Some ATS platforms can process columns, but others may read them out of order or merge unrelated text together. Multi-column resumes increase parsing risk because job titles, dates, skills, and bullet points may not be interpreted in the sequence you intended. For maximum compatibility, use a single-column layout with standard headings and clear spacing. A plain structure is especially important when applying through large employer portals or older recruiting systems.',
  'Do ATS systems reject resumes automatically?':
    'Some employers use knockout questions, required qualifications, or filters that can remove applicants from consideration before a recruiter reviews them. However, ATS software is primarily a database and workflow tool for storing, searching, and managing applications. Many resumes are still reviewed by recruiters, hiring coordinators, or hiring managers. A resume should therefore be written for both systems and humans: accurate qualifications, clear formatting, and evidence that matches the role.',
  'What is an ATS-friendly resume?':
    'An ATS-friendly resume is a resume formatted so applicant tracking systems can parse the text and recruiters can quickly understand the candidate. It usually uses standard section headings such as Experience, Education, and Skills; readable fonts; simple layouts; consistent dates; and relevant keywords from the job description. ATS-friendly does not mean stuffing keywords or hiding text. It means presenting truthful experience in a clean structure that software can read and people can trust.',
  'Do resume keywords matter for ATS systems?':
    'Resume keywords matter because ATS search tools and recruiter searches often use job-related terms to find matching candidates. Keywords should come naturally from the job description, such as specific tools, certifications, responsibilities, or industry terms. For example, a data analyst role may mention SQL, dashboards, forecasting, or stakeholder reporting. Add keywords only when they reflect real experience. Irrelevant keyword stuffing can make the resume less credible when a recruiter reads it.',
  'Can ATS systems read graphics?':
    'ATS systems generally handle text more reliably than graphics. A chart, icon, image, logo, or skill bar may look polished to a person but provide little usable text to parsing software. If important information appears only inside a graphic, it may be missed or misread. Use graphics sparingly and never rely on them for job titles, company names, dates, skills, or achievements. Keep core resume content in normal selectable text.',
  'Should I use a Word document or PDF for ATS?':
    'Both DOCX and PDF files can work with many modern ATS platforms. DOCX is often the safest choice when instructions are unclear because it is simple for systems to parse and easy for recruiters to open. PDF can also be safe if it is text-based and cleanly exported. The best rule is to follow the employer upload instructions exactly. If the posting asks for PDF, submit PDF; if it asks for Word, submit DOCX.',
  'Do ATS scores guarantee interviews?':
    'ATS scores do not guarantee interviews. Most scores are estimates based on keyword matching, formatting checks, or tool-specific assumptions, not final hiring decisions. Recruiter review, relevant experience, achievements, location, compensation fit, timing, referrals, and overall job match still matter. A high score can suggest that the resume aligns with a posting, but it cannot prove the candidate is the best fit. Treat scores as diagnostics, not promises.',
  'How do I improve ATS compatibility?':
    'Improve ATS compatibility by using a clean single-column layout, standard headings, normal text, consistent dates, and role-relevant keywords. Avoid putting important details in headers, footers, images, charts, or complicated tables. Match language from the job description when it truthfully reflects your background. For example, if the job asks for Salesforce reporting and you have used it, include that phrase in a bullet or skills section with context.',
  'What headings are safest for ATS parsing?':
    'The safest ATS headings are simple, conventional labels that both software and recruiters recognize. Use headings such as Experience, Work Experience, Education, Skills, Certifications, Projects, and Summary. Creative labels like My Journey, Career Highlights, or Technical Toolbox may look distinctive but can reduce clarity. Standard headings help parsing systems categorize information correctly and help recruiters scan quickly without guessing where your qualifications are located.',
  'Can ATS systems read tables?':
    'Some ATS platforms can read simple tables, but tables add parsing risk because cells may be read in the wrong order or lose their relationship to headings. A skills table, for example, might separate tools from proficiency labels in a confusing way. If you use tables, keep them simple and avoid placing essential experience inside them. For maximum compatibility, use plain text sections and bullet points instead of table-based layouts.',
  'Do applicant tracking systems rank every resume?':
    'Applicant tracking systems do not rank every resume in the same way. Some employers configure scoring, filters, or search ranking; others mainly use the ATS as a database and workflow system. Recruiters may search by keywords, review applications in order, or prioritize candidates from referrals and required screening questions. Because behavior varies, the best strategy is a clear, relevant resume rather than trying to reverse-engineer a universal ranking formula.',
  'Is keyword stuffing bad for ATS?':
    'Keyword stuffing is bad resume practice because it can make a resume sound unnatural and less trustworthy. ATS search functions may notice repeated terms, but recruiters still read the resume and expect those terms to be supported by real experience. Instead of repeating a skill many times, place it where it belongs. For example, mention Python in a skills section and in a bullet describing a project where Python was actually used.',
  'What does GeoAIResume ACR measure?':
    'GeoAIResume ACR, or ATS Compatibility Rating, measures how likely a resume format is to avoid preventable parsing problems. It looks at factors such as section clarity, plain-text readability, keyword placement, date consistency, and visual layout risk. A high ACR does not mean the resume will get an interview. It means the document is structured so ATS software and recruiters are less likely to miss important information.',
